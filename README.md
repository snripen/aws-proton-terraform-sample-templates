## AWS Proton Sample Terraform Templates

This repository is a curated list of samplex2 templates to use within AWS Proton that are authored for integration with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).


### Registering Templates Using Template Sync
All of the Templates in this directory are set up to work with [AWS Proton Template Sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/create-template-sync.html). This repository is also a Template Repository. So you can click "Use this template" on the home page of this repo and that will create an identical repo in your account, which you can then use with template sync.
